					Welcome to the Et’aam Food Aid Initiative - a community project initiated by the Camps
					Breakerz Crew & Breakdance School.
				</p>

				<p>
					While teaching children the art of breakdancing is our passion, CB Crew’s ultimate focus
					is the wellbeing of the entire community.

				<p>
					Several months ago, the Crew began providing free meals to a few families in need. Soon
					after, demand flourished and in response to that need we launched the Et’aam Food Aid
					Campaign (formerly CB Crew Food Basket Initiative), aimed at raising funds to make a
					bigger impact within the community.
				</p>

				<p>
					The word “Et’aam” (pronounced ‘it-AHM’) signifies a deep commitment to feeding those in
					need. It perfectly encapsulates our mission to nourish and support Palestinians,
					particularly those facing extreme financial hardship and displacement in the Gaza Strip.
					Through our initiative, we strive to embody the values of our name by making a consistent
					and lasting impact in the lives of others, providing nutrition and resources to as many
					families as we can.
				</p>

				<p>
					Et’aam currently distributes food in both Nuseirat Camp and Deir Al Balah. Our dedicated
					ground teams provide groceries to 25 families each week, filled with everything from
					lifesaving dry goods to rare, nutritious vegetables.
				</p>

				<p>
					With food prices soaring due to scarcity, heightened demand, supply chain issues and
					blockade delays, access to essential nutrition has become a challenge for every individual
					in Gaza. Through our combined efforts, we can fulfill our mission providing nourishment
					and support to community members in need.
				</p>

				<p>
					We invite you to follow along with our journey and dedicated team members via our
					Instagram fundraising page - @etaamfoodaid / @cbcrewlt. If you’d like to learn more about
					our dance crew and the children we mentor, you can find us on our main page -

				<p>
					Thank you for your attention, empathy and contribution! Together, we can make a difference
					in the lives of deserving, vulnerable families.
