About it ( A community program established to provide therapy through drawing, crafting, and graffiti). Pictures of the girls with their drawings to be attached.

- Replace the content of Food access with Support Healing through art.. This is our new (Donate campaign).. The food situation is much better now.
You can name the tab (Healing programs) maybe? if you like.. LINK: https://gofund.me/3799cb423
- For the section page please replace the food photos with the picture down below (named Donate us) with the new text below:

Currently, our focus is on empowering our students to excel in dance and embrace their artistic creativity. We are passionate about providing them with the tools and support they need to heal from trauma and thrive. We’re excited to expand and enrich our programs, but there remains a pressing need for essential supplies, healthy snacks, and dance gear for our wonderful students.

With adequate funding, we can strengthen our specialized programs focused on somatic release, coping skills, and emotional support. These initiatives play a crucial role in helping children restore their sense of well-being and belonging, making a lasting impact on their lives.

Our committed team, equipped with backgrounds in psychology and art therapy, is dedicated to providing holistic support to our community. We truly believe in the transformative power of the performing arts and their ability to foster healing and personal growth. Dance is not just an art form; it’s a pathway to emotional resilience and connection.

Thank you for your empathy and potential contribution. We invite you to consider joining our community of compassionate supporters by signing up for our monthly donation subscription! Your contribution will have a profound impact, enabling us to create positive change. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of our deserving students.
